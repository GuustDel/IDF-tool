    <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>IDF Tool</strong> â€“ your all-in-one solution for working with IDF files.  
        This tool is designed to make it easy to prepare, review, and adjust IDF files so they are ready for production.
    </p>

    <p>
        With this tool, you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Upload existing IDF files</strong> from the SunEwat drawing tool or hand-crafted IDF files.</li>
        <li><strong>Create new IDF files from scratch</strong> when no file is available yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix common issues</strong> so your files are compatible with the production machines.</li>
        <li><strong>Make adjustments</strong> like rotating busbars, adding soldering pads, or renaming strings.</li>
        <li><strong>Visualize your changes</strong> in a clear, interactive way before exporting the final file.</li>
        <li><strong>Download the finished file</strong> and use it directly in production.</li>

        This tool is built to save time, reduce mistakes, and ensure every file meets the requirements for smooth production.
